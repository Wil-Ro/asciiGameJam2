# Ascii Jam Redo
This is a re-attempt at a game created during an ascii-only game jam run at Aberystwyth University. During the actual event some team-mates were unable to attend and we sadly never finished the project.
This is out attempt to actually start and finish the game originally planned.

## ToDo
